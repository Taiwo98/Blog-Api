# Blog-Api

#[] I used Postman to test my blog Api instead of React, still learning react progressively.

#[] Tools used: Nodejs, Express, Postman, Body-parser, Mongoose, Nodemon, Dotenv.

#[] Areas of attention: Connection to Database--- I installed a dotenv package to store my database connection.
                        
                        I used a middleware on "posts" so each time I use my router I don't need to specify the name of the route.
